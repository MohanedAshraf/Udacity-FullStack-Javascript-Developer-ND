# Session 7

## ðŸ“– Overview

In this session, we learned what's password hashing why we need to use the salt + pepper technique and discussed the problems of hashing -- [example](./password-hashing/).
We started to test our models and controllers [pokemons-gallery](./pokemon-gallery/).
We learned JWT and discussed the traditional approach of users authentication and why JWT saves us from unnecessary database lookups.
We created our Auth middleware to make our routes protected.
