# Session 6

## ðŸ“– Overview

In this session, we learned how to design your database using different relationships.
We migrated our [database schema](./SQL_SCHEMA.sql).
We started to implement our database design by creating models for every [Entity](./REQUIREMENTS..md) in our [pokemons-gallery](./pokemon-gallery/) app.
We created controllers to deal with our app logic and then the routes.
We learned how to test our endpoints by postman application, you can import [this postman collection](./pokemons_gallery.postman_collection.json)
